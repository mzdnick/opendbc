  All three describe one fact, and stock pairs them absolutely -- RADAR_HAS_LEAD=1 never came
  with all six slots empty, and has_lead=0 always came with phase=0 -- so they are read off one
  piece of state here rather than computed separately and kept in step by hand.

  The state is perception, not control: a stock radar reports its objects ignition to ignition,
  and stock shows RADAR_HAS_LEAD=1 with cruise disengaged in 19.5% of all frames. Tying the
  advertisement to engagement instead made a real car 4.5 m ahead vanish from the bus in one
  frame when the driver braked out of a creep (route 0000004d t+212); the camera, still watching
  the car close in its own vision, ran its SCBS display six seconds -- a pattern absent from
  50 h of stock driving. So this updates every control frame, engaged or not, for as long as we
  stand in for the radar.

  Two things make the state more than a copy of leadVisible. A marginal vision lead flickers
  faster than any real radar ever would (route 6bb2dc61c4 t+400: 6 toggles in 1.4 s on a 120 m
  lead), so visibility is adopted only once it has held steady, the way Hyundai debounces its
  lead bit. And leadOne drops to zero the instant vision loses the lead, well before that
  debounce expires; advertising a fabricated stand-in over the gap put a stationary object
  10.25 m dead ahead on the bus at 22 m/s, so the last real measurement is coasted across it
  instead, the way a radar coasts a track.
